# NE555_pwm_SMD
Simple, small and cheap PWM regulator on NE555.

Single-sided pcb layout with only 1 jumper.

You can use it to drive 12V motor, LED strip, Peltier module, lightbulb etc.
PCB dimensions: 34.29 x 20.63 mm. 
Pulse width regulated by standard potentiometer.
You can use any Mosfet in DPAK (TO-252) case as You like and follow Your requirements. I am using 2SK3918 from old pc motherboard.

I also designed even smaller version with components on both sides, but is now without tests. 

As soon as possible i make photos and movie to show prototype.

If You want to make it, just download the ne555_pwm_smd_top.pdf file, print it and make thermotransfer.
All SMD resistors and capacitors are in 1206 cases.
You can find part list in bom.txt file.
